This was my first coding project and is an Educational Web-App (Physical Chemistry) developed in 2017/18 for my final year Dissertation Project which I received a grade of 67% for.

The Web-App takes the user through an important principle in Physical Chemistry & Physics: the interaction between radiation and matter. 

Some features are not present as they are no longer required, this comprised of a link to a Google Forms questionaire to quiz the students on what they had learnt.
