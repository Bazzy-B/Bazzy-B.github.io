This was my first coding project and is an Educational Web-App (Physical Chemistry) developed in 2017/18 for my final year Dissertation Project which I received a grade of 67% for.

The Web-App takes the user through an important principle in Physical Chemistry & Physics: the interaction between radiation and matter. 

Some features are not present as they are no longer required, this comprised of a link to a Google Forms questionaire to quiz the students on what they had learnt. 

The app uses almost exclusively the HTML5 Canvas element using JavaScript to define what happens on the Canvas. As well as this there are html page navigation buttons.
